# RayTracingEngine

## Overview
This project is a lightweight, CPU-based ray tracing engine that demonstrates foundational concepts of computer graphics and rendering. It simulates realistic lighting effects, including shading, reflections, refractions, and shadows.

## Features
- **Ray-Sphere and Ray-Triangle Intersections**: Efficient algorithms for accurate geometry handling.
- **Materials**:
  - Lambertian (diffuse)
  - Metal (reflective)
  - Dielectric (refractive)
- **Shading**: Implements Phong shading for realistic light interaction.
- **Anti-Aliasing**: Smooths rendered images by averaging multiple samples per pixel.
- **Depth of Field**: Configurable focus and defocus for camera realism.
- **Multithreaded Rendering**: Optimized rendering pipeline.
