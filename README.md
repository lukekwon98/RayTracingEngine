# RayTracingEngine

## Overview
This project is a lightweight, CPU-based ray tracing engine that demonstrates foundational concepts of computer graphics and rendering. It simulates realistic lighting effects, including shading, reflections, refractions, and shadows.

## Features
- **Ray-Sphere and Ray-Triangle Intersections**: Algorithms for accurate geometry handling.
- **Materials**:
  - Lambertian (diffuse)
  - Metal (reflective)
  - Dielectric (refractive)
